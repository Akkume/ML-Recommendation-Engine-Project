# ML-Recommendation-Engine-Project

This Python script implements a basic music recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and can be accessed through Google Colab. Below is a summary of the functionality and steps involved in the implementation:
ðŸ‘‰The script uses collaborative filtering to recommend music based on user ratings. It considers existing user ratings for certain songs and predicts the ratings for new songs for a given user.

#Usage
ðŸ‘‰User Input:
The script starts by taking user input for a few songs with their ratings.

ðŸ‘‰Data Preparation:
A sample dataset is created with songs and their genres.

ðŸ‘‰Matrix Multiplication:
The script then performs matrix multiplication to calculate a user profile based on the provided ratings.

ðŸ‘‰Normalization:
The user profile is normalized to ensure meaningful recommendations.

ðŸ‘‰New Song Recommendations:
Finally, the script provides recommendations for new songs based on the calculated user profile.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. Enjoy discovering new music!

Happy coding!
